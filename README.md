# Tic Tac Toe Family

Tic Tac Toe Family is a reimagination of the classic game: pieces can move, have ranks and can stack on top of one another. With different variants available to play, it transforms a solved childhood game into a complex tactical battleground. Bot support is available if playing alone.

This game is built using Compose Multiplatform and it runs on Android, iOS, Web, Desktop (JVM).
